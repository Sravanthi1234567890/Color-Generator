# Color-Generator
Developed a dynamic web-based application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that allows users to input red, green, and blue (RGB) values to generate custom background colors in real time. The project showcases interactive color manipulation, providing users with a hands-on experience in understanding RGB color models while instantly reflecting the chosen values as the page's background color.
